###A Note About Large Cap Stocks Excluded from the Charts

Varro has chosen to omit Big Biopharma, health insurance and healthcare distribution stocks from the charts because they are traded at high volumes and have less information asymmetry. Instead, the charts tend to focus on biotechnology, molecular diagnostics, and medical device companies.
<br>
<br>
Two exceptions are Biogen (BIIB) and Vertex (VRTX), which Varro finds to be worth tracking due to recent information asymmetry. Biogen stock cratered by ~30% in March 2019 after the failure of its Alzheimer's drug, aducanumab, and has not recovered since. Vertex is fighting a price battle over its cystic fibrosis drugs in Europe, continues to make aggressive investments in bleeding edge technology (CRISPR Therapeutics and Semma Therapeutics), and is about to see its well-regarded CEO retire.


###A Note about “Estimated Price Per Share” Data 

These visualizations use a data source that sometimes displays different funds paying different 
“Estimated Prices Per Share” for the same stock for during the same quarter. This is the result of an algorithm that takes into account the following: 

* Stock price at the quarter end date 
* Past quarterly 13F transactions and a fund’s buying and selling patterns over time. 

These figures are intended to be rough approximations since the fund could have purchased the position at any time 
during the quarter. 

Additionally, the “Estimated Price Per Share” for companies that IPO’d during the quarter will always be the opening 
trade price, not the IPO price. In fact, many of the funds likely paid the IPO price, or even less, depending on if 
they participating in private funding rounds. This murkiness is why the visualizations do not display IPO companies by
default. They must be toggled on, and even then, should be taken with a grain of salt because the data source is 
imperfect. 





###Inclusion Criteria for Institutional Investors

To be included in these visualizations, an institutional investor must satisfy at least one of the following criteria: 
1) Have over 70% of its portfolio value invested in the healthcare sector in the most recent quarter AND 
self-identify in a publically-available document as having a focus on the healthcare sector.
2) Have made a series of “bold”, thematically-linked healthcare investments, either public or private. 
What constitutes a “bold” investment is at Varro’s discretion. 

###Exclusion Criteria for Institutional Investors

If an institutional investor meets one of the following criteria, it is excluded from the visualization: 

1) Rarely lists new buys and sells on SEC Form 13F. This rules out private equity and venture capital firms that hold stock after IPOs, but do not buy and sell much beyond that. 

2) Has a stated focus on algorithmic or quantiative 
trading. This rules out Renaissance Technologies LLC, Two Sigma Advisers LP, D.E. Shaw & Company Inc, and other firms.
 
3) Has trillions of dollars in assets under management and “owns stock in everything.” This rules out BlackRock Inc,
Fidelity Investments Inc, Vanguard Group Inc, State Street Corp, and other firms.
